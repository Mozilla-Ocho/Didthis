        <h3>Didthat Terms of Service</h3>
        <p><em>Last Updated: June 29, 2023.</em><br/><br/></p>
        <p>Didthat is a platform that allows you to document and share your hobbies and projects (“Didthat”). Didthat is currently in the beta phase and is available for select beta users only.</p>
        <p>Please read these Terms of Service (the “Terms”) carefully because they explain important information about your use of Didthat. By using Didthat, you agree to be bound by these Terms, the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Notice</a>, and the <a href="/content">Didthat Content Policies</a>. If you agree to these Terms on behalf of an entity, such as your employer, you represent that you are authorized to and intend to bind that entity.</p>
        <h4>You’ll Need A Didthat Account</h4>
        <p>To use Didthat, you will need to create a Didthat account, which requires you to provide your email address and create a username and password.</p>
        <h4>Your Privacy</h4>
        <p>The Didthat Privacy Notice explains what information you provide to Mozilla when you use Didthat, and how we handle that information.</p>
        <h4>You Must Be Eligible</h4>
        <p>You must be 18 or older to sign up for and use Didthat.</p>
        <h4>Permissions for Didthat</h4>
        <p>Your Use of the Service. Mozilla gives you permission to use Didthat according to these Terms. This permission is only for beta testing and internal evaluation purposes only.  You may not transfer, sublicense, or resell the Didthat service.</p>
        <p>Your Feedback and Suggestions. Mozilla may collect suggestions, ideas or feedback (collectively, the “Feedback”) directly from you (including through third-party platforms such as Mozilla’s discord channels) or through your usage/interaction of Didthat (for example, your clicks on Didthat). You grant Mozilla permission to use, reproduce, distribute, and modify the Feedback for any purpose (including incorporating your Feedback into Didthat), without any obligation of compensation or attribution to you.</p>
        <p>Mozilla’s Intellectual Property. Neither Mozilla nor its licensors grant you any intellectual property rights in Didthat or other Mozilla services that are not specifically stated in these Terms. For example, these Terms do not provide the right to use any copyrights, trademarks, or other distinctive brand features of Mozilla or its licensors.</p>
        <p>Your Intellectual Property. You retain your rights to any content you post or submit through Didthat. By submitting or posting content to Didthat, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, sublicensable, and royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, publish, and display your content on Didthat. This license authorizes us to make your content available publicly and to let others do the same.</p>

You agree that you will comply with the Didthat <a href="/content">Content Policies</a>. We reserve the right to remove or limit the visibility of such content, and to suspend any users we reasonably believe have violated the Didthat Content Policies, however, we cannot take responsibility for all content posted on Didthat.</li>
